    If you see a Jupyter server home page, then look towards the upper right part of your browser.
    Click the "New" button, then select "Terminal" from the dropdown menu.
    The Jupyter commandline terminal window will open in a new tab.
    
    In the Jupyter terminal window, clone this repo as follows:
    > git clone https://github.com/radiasoft/rssynergia
    
    Go back to the JupyterHub home page (i.e. the URL referenced above)
    You should see that there is now a directory called 'rssynergia'
    Drill down into this directory by clicking on directory names, to:
    .../rssynergia/examples/drift_expansion/
    
    Click on the Jupyter notebook named "sc_drift_expansion.ipynb"
